    <h1>Our Food</h1>
    <p>One small but significant detail about Ghanaian local food is the communal way it's often enjoyed. Dishes are frequently served in large bowls placed in the center, and everyone gathers around to eat together. It's common to eat with your right hand, using a ball of fufu, banku, or kenkey to scoop up the flavorful stews and soups. This shared eating experience highlights the strong sense of community and togetherness that is often intertwined with Ghanaian culture.</p>

            <p>Fufu is a staple food in many West African countries, including Ghana. It's made by boiling starchy foods like cassava, yams, or plantains and then pounding them into a smooth, stretchy dough-like consistency. Fufu is typically served with rich soups or stews, making it a hearty and filling dish.</p>
